  <ul>
    <li>Charles Cross - LT

    </li>
    
    <li>Abraham Lucas - RT
      <ul> <li>Has been very good blocking for the right side thus far as a rookie. Shows great promise for the future of the seahawks line ecspecially paired with Cross.</li></ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Tariq Woolen - CB
      <ul> <li>He has had ups and downs but has progressed very fast and is already starting to make big plays on the ball. A steal in the draft.</li></ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Coby Bryant - CB
      <ul> <li>He has been mostly solid as a slot corner.</li></ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Ken Walker - RB
    <ul> <li>he has been very quite so far but may still be recovering from injury. Either way he isn't needed on feild while penny is healthy.</li></ul>

    <li>Dareke Young - WR</li>
    <li>Bo Melton - WR</li>
    <li>Boye Mafe - OLB
